An end-to-end data analysis project exploring the global happiness index across 10 years using Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas) for data cleaning
- SQL for querying insights (Optiional here)
- Tableau for data visualization

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle â€“ World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yadiraespinoza/world-happiness-2015-2024)
- Cleaned version: `happiness_master.csv` (included in this repo)
